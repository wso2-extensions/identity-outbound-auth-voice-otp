# Create claims

1. Create "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/voiceotp_disabled" claim 

* Go to management console -> claims -> Add -> Add Local Claim 
* Enter "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/voiceotp_disabled" as the claim URI
* Enter "voiceotp_disabled" as the Display Name  and Description.
* Add correct attribute mapping for this claim for the Primary userstore.

2. Create "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/failedVoiceOtpAttempts" claim similarly.
3. Create "http://wso2.org/claims/otpbackupcodes" claim similarly if it is not exists.
4. Create "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/failedLoginLockoutCount" claim similarly if it is not exists.
5. Create "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/accountLocked" claim similarly if it is not exists.
6. Create "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/unlockTime" claim similarly if it is not exists.
7. Create "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/lockedReason" claim similarly if it is not exists.

# Service provider based configurations

# IdP Configurations

Create a new IdP for the external Voice OTP provider with VoiceOTP authenticator. 

1. Tick "Enable" checkbox
2. Enter the API endpoint URL of the voice otp provider as the "Voice URL"(Mandatory).The placeholders are $ctx.num which will be replaced with the user's mobile number and $ctx.otp which will replace with the otp .
3. Enter the REST API method name of the endpoint as the "Http Method"(Mandatory)
4. Enter the headers required(eg : Authorization header) to invoke the endpoint as the "HTTP Headers". The placeholders are $ctx.num which will be replaced with the user's mobile number and $ctx.otp which will replace with the otp .
5. Enter the payload with the placeholders if required for the endpoint as the "Http Payload". The placeholders are $ctx.num which will be replaced with the user's mobile number and $ctx.otp which will replace with the otp .
6. Enter the successful response code which will return from the Voice otp provider(eg : 200 , 201) as the "HTTP Response code". If nothing specifies in here, connector will check whether the response code is either 201,202,200 and consider all three as successful scenario.
7. If the "Enable OTP Separation" is enabled, the otp will be separated with the character that enters to the "Separate OTP Digits" section. Enabling this required if it is necessary to split and speak the numbers.
8. The "Separate OTP Digits" section represents the character which needs to be added between the otp numbers before sending to the Voice OTP provider. For example, by default it will have "%2B" which represents URL encoded space character. 
9. The "Divisor value" represents how the otp number separation should be handled. For example the default value is 1 and it will add the separation character explains in 6th point between every number. Eg: 1%2B2%2B3%2B4%2B5%2B6. If the divisor value is two it will be like 12%2B34%2B56. And it will speak like "TWELVE THIRTYFOUR FIFTYSIX" during the call.
10. Enter true for the "Show Detailed Error Information" section if you need detailed error message.
11. Enter any comma separated values to the "Mask values in Error Info " section, if you need some error text needs to be masked with "*"
12. Enter the regex pattern in the "Mobile Number Regex Pattern" section, if it is required to validate the mobile number pattern when capturing and updating the mobile number during the authentication(When user doesn't have a mobile number configured in the user profile).
13. Enter error message for invalid mobile number pattern in the "Regex Violation Error Message" section.
